# Cheat_Without_Looking

This is a Unity mini game project meant to demonstrate how narrow our vision is when focused.

The program uses modified VR with pupil lab eye tracker inside.

The purpose of the game is to duplicate the drawing next to your drawing board without dirctly look into them. 
If player is found cheating by directly looking into the canvas next to the board, game is over. This process is controlled by pupil lab eye tracker.
